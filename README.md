This includes the latest (as of 2014 May 25) open sources of Fira 3.106 from
[Carrois Type Design GbR Berlin](http://dev.carrois.com) as well as compiled
versions of all available variants.

Custom ascender and descender calculations have been removed from the Fira Mono

they guarantee a sane line height on Mac OS X.
